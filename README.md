This project leverages the NSL-KDD dataset to enhance network intrusion detection systems by addressing limitations in the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset. The analysis involves using Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib for dataset exploration, identifying biases, and visualizing insights. Machine learning models, including XGBoost and Logistic Regression, are constructed and optimized for effective intrusion detection. Data preparation techniques, such as preprocessing and feature engineering with Scikit-learn, are applied to improve model performance. The project demonstrates improved detection accuracy through detailed analysis and advanced modeling techniques, underscoring the value of machine learning in fortifying network security.
